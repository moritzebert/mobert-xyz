      Until recently, I didn’t have a proper backup strategy for my NAS. I simply replicated the data to an external hard drive, which was also located in my apartment – essentially the only copy of my data.
Now that I’m using my NAS in a production environment and primarily store important data there, I need a reliable method to back up this data securely to the cloud and restore it in case of a failure.
